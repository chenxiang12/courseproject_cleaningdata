The file describes the output dataset.
The variables in the dataset are the following:

subject_ID: Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activity: Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist,
this variable can be one of the six activities.
All other variables have a self-explained name. In the name of this variables, "Acc" represents linear acceleration and "Gyro" represents angular velocity.
"X","Y" and "Z" indicate 3-axial directions. "mean" and "std" represent mean value and standard deviation value respectively.
THe symbol "t" and "f" indicate time and frequency domain respectively. Here are some of the variables:
tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-std()-Zh
tGravityAcc-mean()-X
tGravityAcc-mean()
......
The most important thing you should keep in mind is that each value is a average of all observations for a specific subject_ID and activity.
